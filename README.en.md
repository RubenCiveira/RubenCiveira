## What I bring to the table  

- **Learner** → quickly absorb new technologies and transfer them to the team, acting as an early adopter in critical modernizations (SPA+REST, API First, microfrontends).  
- **Responsibility & deliberation** → deliver projects on time, with quality and risk mitigation (e.g. ITPV at Abanca, 10,000+ smart POS deployed).  
- **Maximizer** → turn stalled projects into tangible successes (Meet-tap, Sanitas, Quenda Refactor).  
- **Significance** → seek real impact: technology independence from vendors, regaining client trust, international scalability.  
- **Developer (people)** → detect and grow talent in teams, ensuring knowledge transfer and professional development.
